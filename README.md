# **BeatKey**

### What is BeatKey?
That's a good question, BeatKey is me exploring the audio programming space and making things along the way. I originally wanted BeatKey to be a software where you could find the BPM and key/scale of an audio, but as I continued to learn and explore the space, it's shaped into a more exploratory project.

Functions of BeatKey, as of now:
- Extracting Duration
- Extracting Sample Rate
- Extracting BPM
- Extracting Key and Scale
  - via 2 different algorithms in the Essentia library
- Adjusting Tempo/BPM and Pitch
  - GUI with the ability to load an audio file and change its tempo and pitch

Dependencies:
- librosa
- essentia
- numpy
- matplotlib
- tkinter
- pyrubberband
- soundfile

- I picked tracks that are popular and well-known within their respective genres
- I also tried to pick tracks that are diverse in terms of mood, key, and time period
